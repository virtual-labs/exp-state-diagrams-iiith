 1. A student was asked to design the state diagram of a circuit to detect 1011 occurs in a given input sequence. So, he came up with the following design.

a. What will be the sequence of states and outputs for the following input sequence 10101101011000
b. Does the circuit correctly solve the problem. Why/why not? If not then what should be the change in the state diagram?


2. Design a clocked sequential circuit for the following state diagram :

Use JK flip flops and combinational logic in the design. Import the flip flops as black boxes. There will be an input x to the circuit.

(HINT: Make excitation tables for J,K of the flip flops. The present state, and input x will be fed to combinational logic, which will generate J,K for each flip flop.)
