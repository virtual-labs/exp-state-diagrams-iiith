            "explanations": {
                "a":"To detect a sequence of 3 or more 1s, we need to remember the previous two bits to compare them with the current bit. Therefore, we require less than 3 flip-flops to store this information.",
                "b":"In the state diagram for the sequence of 3 there will be 4 states 0 (that is 0 consecutive 1s), 1 (that is 1 consecutive 1s), 2 (that is 2 consecutive 1s) and 3 (that is 3 consecutive 1s). So for 4 states there will be 2 flip flops required to implement the circuit.",
                "c":"With only 1 flip-flop, we can only remember the current bit and have no way of comparing it with the previous bits to detect a sequence of 3 or more 1s.",
                "d":"While having additional flip-flops would provide extra storage, they are not necessary to detect a sequence of 3 or more 1s."
