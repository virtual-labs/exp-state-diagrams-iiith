                "a":"Number of flip-flops required are equal to log(Number of states) with base 2",
                "b":"Since each flip-flop can represent only 2 states, having 4 flip-flops would allow for a total of 16 possible states. This exceeds the requirement of representing only 8 distinct states",
                "c":"Having 8 flip-flops would provide a total of 256 possible states, which is far more than the 8 distinct states required.",
                "d":"Having only 1 flip-flop would limit the representation to just 2 possible states"

                "b":"The logical XOR operation returns 1 if the number of 1's in the inputs is odd. However, this expression includes all three inputs A, B, and C, which means the value of C may affect the result even if A and B alone satisfy the odd number condition.",
                "c":"An odd number is decided based upon the LSB in this case LSB is C as a result Y = C",
                "d":"The logical OR operation would result in 1 if either B or C (or both) is 1, but this does not necessarily guarantee that the binary value is an odd number."

                "b":"Skipping just 1 state will leave us with another extra state that is not utilized",
                "c":"With 3 flip-flops, we can represent a total of 8 different states. Since we only need 6 states for the mod 6 counter, there will be some states that are not utilized or skipped",
