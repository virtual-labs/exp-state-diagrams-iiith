Learn everything from the 'Demo' section.

In the 'Practice' section you need to make the circuit for the given state diagram. The circuit is to be made using JK flip-flops, you can test your circuit after entering an input binary string and then click on simulate.

After performing the tasks observe the relationship between the number of flip-flops needed and number of states
